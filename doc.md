## 1. Project Overview & Story

Shopping for fashion, accessories, and shoes should be quick and enjoyable—not stressful! Team 5*A’s mission was to create an engaging, visually rich, and feature-complete e-commerce experience geared toward trendy young users. Our inspiration came from the clutter and limitations of current online fashion stores. We imagined a **modular, maintainable solution** that is easy for groups to improve and extend.

---

## 2. Fact-Finding & User Interviews

We polled real users—students, young adults, and even parents—about their online shopping pain points:

| Concern                         | Response Summary                                    |
|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Confusing navigation             | Users want clear, visible categories               |
| Slow product search              | Need instant/product live search                   |
| Cart errors, lost items          | Must persist cart reliably and show analytics      |
| Flat design, boring visuals      | Responsive, lively sections and banners            |
| Frustrating authentication       | One-tab login/signup, simple password reset        |
| Hidden policies (refund, terms)  | Policies accessible from navigation/footers        |

We distilled this into our feature roadmap and page structure.

## 3. Requirement Analysis

**User Stories:**  
- As a shopper, I want to browse categories (Men, Women, Kids, Accessories, Shoes) from the main menu.
- As a user, I want to save favorites to my wishlist and edit my cart from any device.
- As an admin, I need to review and update site policies quickly.
- As a guest, I want to order, track, and submit product feedback.
- As a contributor, I want a page to recognize my work and stats.

**Technical Needs:**  
- HTML/CSS/JS static architecture for easy deployment.  
- Responsive design, theme toggle, animated banners.  
- Modular scripts/styles for maintainability.

---

## 4. Planning

**Immediate Priorities:**
- Modular page structure (index + category/feature/policy pages)
- Interactive cart, popups, search, and FAQ
- Robust navigation and theming

**Stack:**
- Vanilla HTML5, CSS3 (incl. modular: `/Style/`, root CSS)
- JavaScript ES6+, per-feature scripts in `/script/`
- Static asset hosting; accessible on localhost or any file server

**Timeline:**  
Week 1: Planning, UI design, base navigation  
Week 2: Product pages, cart, search, feedback, wishlist  
Week 3: Auth, modals, policies, contributors, polish

## 6. Implementation

- **Navigation:** JavaScript-powered dropdowns, active-tab highlighting, mobile and desktop.
- **Product/Category pages:** Each HTML shows products with images, prices, and action buttons. Category-specific CSS for effects, grid layout.
- **Cart, Wishlist & Auth:** Dynamic, stateful (browser memory/localStorage), in-page controls.
- **Popups & Modals:** Modular scripts for sign-up, cart, email collection, and info overlays.
- **Feedback/Contact:** Forms, rating, and message logic, JS validation.
- **Search & FAQ:** Live product search, questions/answers expandable with JS.
- **Contributors Page:** Team bios, stats, avatars, dynamic badges.

---

## 7. Testing, Deployment & Maintenance

- **Local testing:** All features confirmed on Chrome, Firefox, Edge.
- **Device compatibility:** Checked on phone/tablet via responsive CSS (media queries).
- **Usability:** All navigation, cart, popup, and login flows tested in isolation.
- **Maintenance:** Modular scripts/styles; contributors.html for adding team details; all policy pages can be edited independently.
